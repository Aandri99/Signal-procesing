Using the Red Pitaya for measuring properties of periodic waveforms
===================

Goals of this Lab
-----------------

1. Demonstrate ability to use Oscilloscope, Signal Generator, and Spectrum Analyzer capabilities of Red Pitaya through GUI.

2. Configure Red pitaya to receive external inputs.

3. Perform measurements on a multitude of periodic waveforms

Tasks / Measurements

--------------------
Configure the Red Pitaya for a Loopback configuration (SMA cables tied between the outputs and inputs to the Red Pitaya) as shown in Fig. 1.
